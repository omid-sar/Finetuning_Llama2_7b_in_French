# Fine-tuning Llama-2-7b using QLoRA on Google Colab

## Goal

The goal of this project is to fine-tune the Llama-2-7b model on a single T4 GPU provided by Google Colab to turn it into a chatbot that can respond to questions in French. We leverage the PEFT library from the Hugging Face ecosystem and QLoRA for more memory-efficient fine-tuning.

## Overview

This project involves several steps including setting up the environment, loading the dataset and model, configuring QLoRA and training parameters, training the model, and finally testing and pushing the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face.

## Features

- **Dataset Loading**: Load and process a French novels dataset using Hugging Face datasets library.
- **Model Quantization**: Quantize the base Llama-2-7b model into 4-bit using bitsandbytes.
- **Configuration for QLoRA**: Apply the QLoRA configuration for more memory-efficient fine-tuning using the PEFT library.
- **Training**: Use the SFTTrainer from the TRL library for instruction-based fine-tuning.
- **Testing and Pushing to Hugging Face**: Test the fine-tuned model and push it to Hugging Face.

## Prerequisites

- Google Colab with T4 GPU
- Python libraries: trl, transformers, accelerate, peft, datasets, bitsandbytes, einops

## Setup and Installation

Run the following commands in your Google Colab notebook to install the required libraries:

```bash
!pip install -q -U trl transformers accelerate git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git
!pip install -q datasets bitsandbytes einops
```
